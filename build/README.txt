This app allows you to tidy up your timeline using flows. Besides that it gives you the option to create a notification that will delete itself after a certain period of time.Â 

For cleanup, you have the following options:
- Delete all notifications
- Delete all notifications of a specific category
- Delete all notifications that contain a specified text
- Detele all notifications older than a certain age

Combinations of these also possible. I'm open to suggestions, let me know what you are missing.

Note 1:
The app uses the Web Api, so first thing you need to do is head over to the App Setup screen and enter your Homey account credentials to obtain the right permissions. If authentication fails, please report the error code to determine why it failed.

Note 2:
If the app (or Homey) is restarted, notifications that should delete themselves won't be deleted, you need to clean them up yourself :)
